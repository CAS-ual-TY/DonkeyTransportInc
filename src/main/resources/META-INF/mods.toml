This mod is as great as it sounds. Disclaimer: There is no actual company or trade mark involved, this is a joke.

Steps on how to use this mod:
- You get the Donkey Hypnotizerâ„¢
- This item is spawned whenever a donkey is struck by lightning
- You mark waypoints with it
- You click the donkey to hypnotize it
- The donkey now goes to the first waypoint
- You slap the donkey and it goes to the next waypoint
- Pro tip: Use snowballs

Additional features:
- Donkeys with chests now interact with hoppers
- Press F3+B to see which hoppers a hypnotized donkey interacts with
